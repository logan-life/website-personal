### Coursework

<br>



The following courses comprise the essential core of the [Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/master-of-computer-and-information-technology/) program at the University of Pennsylvania. These courses helped me develop a comprehensive understanding of programming fundamentals, computer systems and architecture, and computer science mathematics.
