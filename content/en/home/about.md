Hi! I'm Logan. I'm in the process of re-skilling into computer science and software development at the University of Pennsylvania. If you're interested, you can read more about how I spend my time in the sections below.

I'm currently thinking about bias in artificial intelligence systems, decreasing human work burdens, climate change, and more. I am seeking full-time work in software development to begin in summer 2021.
