I'm a computer science and software development student at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm passionate about dedicating my time and energy to improving the human condition. I'm especially interested in driving technical solutions to our climate crisis and elevating human welfare through social justice. 

I am seeking full-time employment in software engineering / web development to begin in Summer 2021.
