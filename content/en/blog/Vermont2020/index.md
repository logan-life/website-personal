My best bud [John](http://branigan.net/) has been spending time in the woods at [Little River State Park](https://vtstateparks.com/littleriver.html) near Waterbury, Vermont, once per year for a few years now. In September of 2019, we booked two sites to head up there together with our partners. COVID meant he was unable to make it, so it was just me and my spouse.

It's stressful to travel during COVID. Vermont, at time of writing, is still the only "green" state in the US with regards to COVID prevalence. A week away from cell-service, with a greater sense of psychological safety from the pandemic, was just what I needed to recover from work burnout and the recent loss of our 13 year old Italian Greyhound, Dennis. About an hour and change from Little River, there's a place called [Dog Mountain](https://www.dogmt.com/Dog-Mountain.html). We took Dennis's photo there, and added it to the thousands of other photos adorning the chapel there. Painful and peaceful in equal measure, I'm glad we did it.

I'll eventually make a post just for Dennis, once I can bear it. For now, here's some photos from the trip.
