      <description>My friend John camps yearly at the Little River State Park near Waterbury, Vermont. We booked two sites back in September of 2019, intending to camp there together with our partners. He could not join us due to COVID, but my spouse and I decided to go anyway.
Travelling during COVID is stressful. Travelling to Vermont was easier - when we arrived, it was the only &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; state in the US with regards to COVID prevalence.</description>
