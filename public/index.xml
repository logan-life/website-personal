      <description>My best bud John has been spending time in the woods at Little River State Park near Waterbury, Vermont, once per year for a few years now. In September of 2019, we booked two sites to head up there together with our partners. COVID meant he was unable to make it, so it was just me and my spouse.
It&amp;rsquo;s stressful to travel during COVID. Vermont, at time of writing, is still the only &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; state in the US with regards to COVID prevalence.</description>
